    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This better-than-sex cake recipe is made with German chocolate cake mix, hot fudge dessert topping,
        and chocolate-covered English toffee. It's crazy good!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 cups hot fudge topping</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>4 (1.4 ounce) bars English toffee-flavored candy, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well
            combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>

            Remove from the oven and set the baking dish on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>While the cake is still very warm, poke holes all over the top with the end of a wooden spoon. Pour
            condensed milk over cake and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour hot fudge topping over cooled cake and let set, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
